				<p class='methode-graf'>Two turntables and a fire extinguisher: How one DJ set Boston hip-hop ablaze</p>
<p class='methode-graf'>Boston’s rep is as a rock town, but we matter more to hip-hop than people realize. </p>
<p class='methode-graf'>It was Roxbury’s New Edition that, starting in the ’80s, made it safe for mainstream radio to play hip-hop, both with its own mix of Motown and rap, and through the subsequent successes of spinoff acts<strong></strong>Bobby Brown and Bell Biv Devoe. New Edition laid the blueprint that still dominates R&amp;B to this day.</p>

<p class='methode-graf'>Hip-hop’s love affair with jazz, made notable by groups like A Tribe Called Quest, was fueled in part by Boston rapper Keith Elam (a.k.a GURU)’s Jazzmatazz projects and his duo Gang Starr, famed for 1990’s “A Jazz Thing.”<a title='www.billboard.com' href='http://www.billboard.com/artist/312165/new-edition/biography'></a></p>
<p class='methode-graf'> Less well known is Boston’s contribution to gangsta rap. The Almighty RSO were four guys from Dorchester--MCs Ray Dog (Raymond Scott), E-Devious (Marco Antonio Ennis), Tony Rhome (Anthony Johnson), and DJ Deff Jeff (Jeff Neal). They became known for their customized Bruins gear and outlandish stage shows. A quick trip through the Massachusetts Hip Hop Archive shows that the RSO Crew was a staple of <em>Lecco’s Lemma,</em> a pioneering rap show that ran on WMBR (88.1 FM) and then WZBC (90.3 FM) between 1985 and 1988. RSO played at block parties, school auditoriums, neighborhood spots like the Rolls Club (now Macumba Latina), and occasionally even at rock clubs the Rat and the Gallery.</p>

<p class='methode-graf'>I still remember a show they did in the early 1990s in the auditorium at Harrington Elementary School (now the King Open School) in Cambridge, along with Boston rapper ED O.G. Onstage with Almighty RSO were the Legion of Doom, an entourage like Public Enemy’s S1Ws, and the 9MM dancers. Deff Jeff started his scratch routine, hip-hop’s version of a guitar solo, where the DJ goes back and forth between turntables creating a rhythm. As he cut the records, faster and faster, the house lights went dim and suddenly both turntables seemed to burst into flames. The crowd exploded with cheers. </p>
<p class='methode-graf'>Neal says he did it to stand out from rivals in the city like Killer DJ and Reesey Cutz (who toured with Bobby Brown). “I was into trick mixing,” he says, “spinning around, behind the back. One day I just thought it would be dope to put my turntables on fire and still be able to mix the records.” He and his production partner, JB, had to come up with a way to do it that didn’t warp the vinyl. Once they did, “I loved to do it but I hated to do it, because that was real fire. I’ve burnt eyelashes. My hands caught on fire,”says Neal, who still lives in Boston and DJs under the name Jeff Two Timez. </p>
<p class='methode-graf'>RSO never caught fire the way Ice-T or NWA did, but they did cause sparks. Around the same time Ice-T’s metal band Body Count came under fire for its song “Cop Killer,” RSO faced its own trouble for “One in the Chamba,” a song that drew a lawsuit from the Boston Police Patrolmen’s Association. But Neal and RSO’s showmanship (minus the controversies) continue to influence young Beantown rappers: Witness Avenue dropping a Ray Dog reference in his songs and donning the black and gold for a video from his new album. </p>
