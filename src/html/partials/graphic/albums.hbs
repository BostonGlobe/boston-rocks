				<p class='methode-graf'>Our Ongoing Romance With The Modern Lovers</p>
<p class='methode-graf'>The Modern Lovers is an essential part of punk mythos, its simple two-chord thrumming sound an influence on seminal punk bands like the Sex Pistols. But the band was never mainstream, even in Boston, where 19-year-old singer and Natick native Jonathan Richman was already a fixture at the hippie-heavy free concerts on the Cambridge Common when he formed the group in 1970. It certainly didn’t help that the band existed less than four years. </p>
<p class='methode-graf'>The Modern Lovers played to often confused audiences in out-of-the way spots like a Harvard boathouse and the auditorium at Gloucester High School; the group also played at the funeral for country rocker/Harvard dropout Gram Parsons. The band didn’t have a manager, didn’t have a tour bus, and it wasn’t popular like Geils, Aerosmith, or Duke &amp; the Drivers (or even Thundertrain). The band never even cut a record. Instead, a West Coast independent label took demo songs and packaged them as the 1976 release <em>The Modern Lovers.</em> By then, Richman had formed a new version of the band and released his own album. But it was the original band’s Velvet Underground intensity and Kinks-y pop charm that got airplay on college radio stations like MIT’s WTBS (now WMBR), attention in alt-weeklies like <em>The Boston Phoenix,</em> and shelf space at record stores like Mo Levy’s Strawberries. The suburban malaise of “Roadrunner,” the cosmic yearning of “Astral Plane,” the art-snob braggadocio of “Pablo Picasso” all found an audience that is still growing 40 years later.</p>

<p class='methode-graf'>Richman, guitarist Jerry Harrison, bassist Ernie Brooks, and drummer David Robinson had created music built on very contrarian attitudes that resonated with optimistic outsiders the world over. The band’s demise would become a crucial part of its appeal in the new, nihilistic punk culture bubbling up in clubs like The Rat in Kenmore Square, CBGB in New York, and the 100 Club in London. Richman kept the Modern Lovers name for his backing bands through most of the ’80s, but his solo career is a troubadour’s. Two of his bandmates, though, achieved New Wave stardom with The Cars (Robinson) and Talking Heads (Harrison). And The Modern Lovers continues to grow in mystique and stature, the legend renewed with every reissue. --Sean Maloney</p>
