<p class='methode-graf'>The fans loved the band, and they were booing.</p>
<p class='methode-graf'>Every time the singer mentioned the call letters of the radio station that was broadcasting live--WBCN--the rowdy crowd at the Godfathers show at the Paradise erupted in a chorus of jeers. Another station, WFNX, had been playing the Godfathers in heavy rotation, but it was BCN, Boston’s big rock station, that snagged the promotion. An aggrieved FNX team had struck back in part by handing showgoers FNX T-shirts welcoming the British punk band to Boston. All night, a crowd of largely FNX listeners heckled the rival station.</p>
<p class='methode-graf'>“Looks like you’re having some radio wars here,” the singer said with a smirk. </p>
<p class='methode-graf'>BCN, based near the Lansdowne Street club scene (across from the current Verb hotel),  was a certified institution. Launched in 1968 as a “free-form” FM radio station, meaning DJs played what they liked, it was famous for introducing American audiences to bands like U2 and Aerosmith and to the idea that DJs could be as important as their music (i.e., Charles Laquidara’s kooky morning show <em>The Big Mattress;</em> the station was also where Kiss 108’s Matt Siegel cut his DJ teeth).</p>
<p class='methode-graf'>But as alternative music emerged, Boston’s vibrant new music scene was ready for a new voice. WFNX, launched in 1983 as the broadcast arm of the alternative weekly <em>Boston Phoenix,</em> went from annoying pebble in the “Rock of Boston’s” shoe to a viable alternative to BCN. FNX was the first in the country to play Nirvana’s “Nevermind” in its entirety. It brought to town another Seattle band called Pearl Jam--as an opening act. And in 1994, the station hosted an infamous free Green Day show at the Hatch Shell for a raucous crowd of 100,000 or so.</p>
<p class='methode-graf'>Like BCN, FNX also rallied behind local bands--the Pixies, Dinosaur Jr., Letters to Cleo, Buffalo Tom--helping fuel the Boston rock scene. Along the way, a steady stream of on-air personalities, among them Kurt St. Thomas, Morning Guy Tai, and Joanne Doody, spent a lot more than just their time slots at the studio on Exchange Street in Lynn.</p>
<p class='methode-graf'>Today, both stations have faded into the ether, victims of radio’s corporate consolidation. WBCN signed off the air in August 2009 to the tune of Pink Floyd’s “Shine on You Crazy Diamond.” (Today you’ll find the “hot adult contemporary” station Mix 104.1 at that spot on the dial.) WFNX hung on until July 2012, when the last DJ spun the Cure’s “Let’s Go to Bed” before shutting out the lights. Now the old, familiar frequency broadcasts country music as 101.7 The Bull. For a time, BCN and FNX were bitter rivals, says longtime FNX DJ Julie Kramer (now at the <em>Globe’</em>s Internet-based RadioBDC). But they shared a common cause, one that’s not so common in radio anymore: “You were going to discover the next big band.” --James Sullivan </p>
